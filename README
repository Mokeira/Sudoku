# SuDoku
SuDoku is a Java implementation  of the popular logic-based puzzle *sudoku*.

I built this for one of my university courses. The objectives of the course were:
+ implement basic user interfaces using a high-level programming language and interface toolkit; 
+ understand and apply concepts of interface layout and event handling; 
+ understand and apply concepts of various interface components such as buttons, lists, and windows
+ understand and appreciate the larger context in which interfaces are designed, implemented, and ultimately used.

## SuDoku Re-factored

This is one of my most memorable undergraduate projects and I enjoyed working on it. The final product had various issues and I am currently in the process of refactoring and improving the code.
